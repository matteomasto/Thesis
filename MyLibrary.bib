	abstract = {In order to obtain high contrast images and detailed descriptions of label free samples, quantitative interferometric microscopy combining with phase retrieval is designed to obtain sample phase distributions from fringes. As accuracy and efficiency of recovered phases are affected by phase retrieval methods, thus approaches owning higher precision and faster processing speed are still in demand. Here, two dimensional Hilbert transform based phase retrieval method is adopted in cellular phase imaging, it not only reserves more sample specifics compared to classical fast Fourier transform based method, but also overcomes disadvantages of traditional algorithm according to Hilbert transform which is a one dimensional processing causing phase ambiguities. Both simulations and experiments are provided, proving the proposed phase retrieval approach can acquire quantitative sample phases with high accuracy and fast speed.},

  abstract     = {Although the LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode material has been widely used in commercial lithium ion batteries (LIB) and shows high stability, LIB’s improvements have several challenges that still need to be overcome. In this paper, we have studied the in-operando structural properties of LCO within battery cells using Bragg Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging to identify ways to optimise the LCO batteries’ cycling. We have successfully reconstructed the X-ray scattering phase variation (a fingerprint of atomic displacement) within a ≈ (1.6 × 1.4 × 1.3) μm³ LCO nanocrystal across a charge/discharge cycle. Reconstructions indicate strained domains forming, expanding, and fragmenting near the surface of the nanocrystal during charging, with a determined maximum relative lattice displacements of 0.467 Å. While discharging, all domains replicate in reverse the effects observed from the charging states, but with a lower maximum relative lattice displacements of 0.226 Å. These findings show the inefficiency-increasing domain dynamics within LCO lattices during cycling.}

  abstract = {New 4th-generation synchrotron sources, with their increased brilliance, promise to greatly improve the performances of coherent X-ray microscopy. This perspective is of major interest for crystal microscopy, which aims at revealing the 3D crystalline structure of matter at the nanoscale, an approach strongly limited by the available coherent flux. Our results, based on Bragg ptychography experiments performed at the first 4th-generation synchrotron source, demonstrate the possibility of retrieving a high-quality image of the crystalline sample, with unprecedented quality. Importantly, the larger available coherent flux produces datasets with enough information to overcome experimental limitations, such as strongly deteriorated scanning conditions. We show this achievement would not be possible with 3rd-generation sources, a limit that has inhibited the development of this otherwise powerful microscopy method, so far. Hence, the advent of next-generation synchrotron sources not only makes Bragg ptychography suitable for high throughput studies but also strongly relaxes the associated experimental constraints, making it compatible with a wider range of experimental set-ups at the new synchrotrons.},

It is therefore unnecessary to oversample the magnitude of Fourier transforms by 2{\texttimes} in each dimension (i.e., oversampling by 4{\texttimes} for 2D and 8{\texttimes} for 3D) in retrieving the phase of 2D and 3D objects. Our computer phasing experiments accurately retrieved the phase from the magnitude of the Fourier transforms of 2D and 3D complex-valued objects by using positivity constraints on the imaginary part of the objects and loose supports, with the oversampling factor much less than 4 for 2D and 8 for 3D objects. Under the same conditions we also obtained reasonably good reconstructions of 2D and 3D complex-valued objects from the magnitude of their Fourier transforms with added noise and a central stop.},

The new form gives a clear and convenient way to implement all basic operations efficiently. A fast rounding procedure is presented, as well as basic linear algebra operations. Examples showing the benefits of the decomposition are given, and the efficiency is demonstrated by the computation of the smallest eigenvalue of a 19-dimensional operator. }

Decompositions of higher-order tensors (i.e., \(N\)-way arrays with \(N \ge 3\)) have applications in psychometrics, chemometrics, signal processing, numerical linear algebra, computer vision, numerical analysis, data mining, neuroscience, graph analysis, and elsewhere. Two particular tensor decompositions can be considered to be higher-order extensions of the matrix singular value decomposition: CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposes a tensor as a sum of rank-one tensors, and the Tucker decomposition is a higher-order form of principal component analysis. There are many other tensor decompositions, including INDSCAL, PARAFAC2, CANDELINC, DEDICOM, and PARATUCK2 as well as nonnegative variants of all of the above. The N-way Toolbox, Tensor Toolbox, and Multilinear Engine are examples of software packages for working with tensors. }

Despite excellent prospects, voltage fade has prevented effective use of the excess capacity, and a major challenge has been a lack of understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the voltage fade. Here, using operando three-dimensional Bragg coherent diffractive imaging, we directly observe the nucleation of a mobile dislocation network in LRLO nanoparticles. The dislocations form more readily in LRLO as compared with a classical layered oxide, suggesting a link between the defects and voltage fade. We show microscopically how the formation of partial dislocations contributes to the voltage fade. The insights allow us to design and demonstrate an effective method to recover the original high-voltage functionality. Our findings reveal that the voltage fade in LRLO is reversible and call for new paradigms for improved design of oxygen-redox active materials.},

abstract = {Biological materials have outstanding properties. With ease, challenging mechanical, optical or electrical properties are realised from comparatively `humble' building blocks. The key strategy to realise these properties is through extensive hierarchical structuring of the material from the millimetre to the nanometre scale in 3D. Though hierarchical structuring in biological materials has long been recognized, the 3D characterization of such structures remains a challenge. To understand the behaviour of materials, multimodal and multi-scale characterization approaches are needed. In this review, we outline current X-ray analysis approaches using the structures of bone and shells as examples. We show how recent advances have aided our understanding of hierarchical structures and their functions, and how these could be exploited for future research directions. We also discuss current roadblocks including radiation damage, data quantity and sample preparation, as well as strategies to address them.},

Popular network architectures often add additional operations and connections to the standard architecture to enable training deeper networks. To achieve accurate results in practice, a large number of trainable parameters are often required. Here, we introduce a network architecture based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data.},

abstract = {Inpainting, the technique of modifying an image in an undetectable form, is as ancient as art itself. The goals and applications of inpainting are numerous, from the restoration of damaged paintings and photographs to the removal/replacement of selected objects. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm for digital inpainting of still images that attempts to replicate the basic techniques used by professional restorators. After the user selects the regions to be restored, the algorithm automatically fills-in these regions with information surrounding them. The fill-in is done in such a way that isophote lines arriving at the regions' boundaries are completed inside. In contrast with previous approaches, the technique here introduced does not require the user to specify where the novel information comes from. This is automatically done (and in a fast way), thereby allowing to simultaneously fill-in numerous regions containing completely different structures and surrounding backgrounds. In addition, no limitations are imposed on the topology of the region to be inpainted. Applications of this technique include the restoration of old photographs and damaged film; removal of superimposed text like dates, subtitles, or publicity; and the removal of entire objects from the image like microphones or wires in special effects.},

ABSTRACT = {Image Inpainting is an age-old image processing problem, with people from different eras attempting to solve it using various methods. Traditional image inpainting algorithms have the ability to repair minor damage such as scratches and wear. However, with the rapid development of deep learning in the field of computer vision in recent years, coupled with abundant computing resources, methods based on deep learning have increasingly highlighted their advantages in semantic feature extraction, image transformation, and image generation. As such, image inpainting algorithms based on deep learning have become the mainstream in this domain.In this article, we first provide a comprehensive review of some classic deep-learning-based methods in the image inpainting field. Then, we categorize these methods based on component optimization, network structure design optimization, and training method optimization, discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. A comparison is also made based on public datasets and evaluation metrics in image inpainting. Furthermore, the article delves into the applications of current image inpainting technologies, categorizing them into three major scenarios: object removal, general image repair, and facial inpainting. Finally, current challenges and prospective developments in the field of image inpainting are discussed.},

abstract = {Images can be described as visual representations or likeness of something (person or object) which can be reproduced or captured, e.g. a hand drawing, photographic material. However, for images on photographic material, images can have defects at the point of captured, become damaged, or degrade over time. Historically, these were restored by hand to maintain image quality using a process known as inpainting. The advent of the digital age has seen the rapid shift image storage technologies, from hard-copies to digitalised units in a less burdensome manner with the application of digital tools. This paper presents a comprehensive review of image inpainting methods over the past decade and the commonly used performance metrics and datasets. To increase the clarity of our review, we use a hierarchical representation for the past state-of-the-art traditional methods and the present state-of-the-art deep learning methods. For traditional methods, we divide the techniques into five sub-categories, i.e. Exemplar-based texture synthesis, Exemplar-based structure synthesis, Diffusion-based methods, Sparse representation methods and Hybrid methods. Then we review the deep learning methods, i.e. Convolutional Neural Networks and Generative Adversarial Networks. We detail the strengths and weaknesses of each to provide new insights in the field. To address the challenges raised from our findings, we outline some potential future works.}

This article contains a detailed description of Eiger detector systems, from the 500 kpixel single-module detector to large-area multi-modules systems. The calibration and performance of the first 500 kpixel system that is in routine user operation are also presented. Furthermore, a method of calibrating the energy of single-photon counting detectors along the detector gain axis is introduced. This approach has the advantage that the detector settings can be optimized at all energies for count rate capabilities. Rate capabilities of the system are reported for energies between 6 and 16 keV.}

We describe an implementation of the optimization procedure for ptychography, using conjugate gradients and including preconditioning strategies, regularization and typical modifications of the statistical noise model. The optimization principle is compared to a difference map reconstruction algorithm. With simulated data important improvements are observed, as measured by a strong increase in the signal-to-noise ratio. Significant gains in resolution and sensitivity are also demonstrated in the ML refinement of a reconstruction from experimental x-ray data. The immediate consequence of our results is the possible reduction of exposure, or dose, by up to an order of magnitude for a reconstruction quality similar to iterative algorithms currently in use.}

It is shown that both the error-reduction algorithm for the problem of a single intensity measurement and the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm for the problem of two intensity measurements converge.

We develop sufficient conditions on the coefficients and the bases to guarantee exact phase retrieval, by which we mean reconstruction up to a global phase factor. We present a new class of discrete-domain signals that are not necessarily minimum-phase, but allow for exact phase retrieval from their Fourier magnitude spectra. We also establish Hilbert transform relations between log-magnitude and phase spectra for this class of discrete signals. It turns out that the corresponding continuous-domain counterparts need not satisfy a Hilbert transform relation; notwithstanding, the continuous-domain signals can be reconstructed from their Fourier magnitude spectra. We validate the reconstruction guarantees through simulations for some important classes of signals such as bandlimited signals and piecewise-smooth signals. We also present an application of the proposed phase retrieval technique for artifact-free signal reconstruction in frequency-domain optical-coherence tomography ({FDOCT}).},

@article{HealingGaps2017,
   abstract = {X-ray scattering images contain numerous gaps and defects arising from detector limitations and experimental configuration. We present a method to heal X-ray scattering images, filling gaps in the data and removing defects in a physically meaningful manner. Unlike generic inpainting methods, this method is closely tuned to the expected structure of reciprocal-space data. In particular, we exploit statistical tests and symmetry analysis to identify the structure of an image; we then copy, average and interpolate measured data into gaps in a way that respects the identified structure and symmetry. Importantly, the underlying analysis methods provide useful characterization of structures present in the image, including the identification of diffuse versus sharp features, anisotropy and symmetry. The presented method leverages known characteristics of reciprocal space, enabling physically reasonable reconstruction even with large image gaps. The method will correspondingly fail for images that violate these underlying assumptions. The method assumes point symmetry and is thus applicable to small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data, but only to a subset of wide-angle data. Our method succeeds in filling gaps and healing defects in experimental images, including extending data beyond the original detector borders.},

This is especially the case in communication systems with amplitude or frequency modulation. These concepts are often introduced empirically. However, it is well known that the correct approach for this purpose is to use the concept of analytic signal. Starting from this point, we show some examples of contradictions appearing when using other definitions of instantaneous amplitude or frequency that are commonly admitted. This introduces the problem of characterizing pure amplitude-modulated or pure phase-modulated signals.

Phase information is obtained from the observed reflection intensity via a logarithmic Hilbert transform and the a priori information is used to select the zeros to be included in the solution. The reconstructed lattice strain profile clearly resolves {SiGe} and Si layers of 90-160 Å thickness alternately stacked on a silicon substrate. The {SiGe} layer is found to have a lattice spacing in the surface-normal direction significantly smaller than predicted by Vegard's law. The result gives simulated rocking-curve profiles in very good agreement with the observation. The apparent deviation from Vegard's law could be confirmed by chemical analysis.},

We examine sample reconstructions that present the twin-image problem to different extents and find that, even when the twin-image problem is not visually evident, it can exist in small regions of the retrieved Fourier phase.

The sampling theorem has been generalized to include nonuniform sampling and the use of derivatives of the signal. In the present paper, a sampling theorem has been developed which utilizes information related to the zeros of the signal. The concept of complex zeros is introduced to show that the zeros occur at the Nyquist rate. This sampling theorem can be of use for enabling the transmission of binary signals, such as facsimile and infinitely-clipped speech, over a continuous band-limited channel.

What is the 'phase' in crystallography? What is 'the problem'? How can we overcome the problem? The paper will emphasize that the phase values can only be discovered through some prior knowledge of the structure. The paper will canter through direct methods, isomorphous replacement, anomalous scattering and molecular replacement. As phasing is the most acronymic realm of crystallography, {MR}, {SIR}, {SIRAS}, {MIR}, {MIRAS}, {MAD} and {SAD} will be expanded and explained in part. Along the way, we will meet some of the heroes of protein crystallography such as Perutz, Kendrew, Crick, Rossmann and Blow who established many of the phasing methods in the {UK}.

However, the undersampling of the diffraction signal due to Fourier-space compression at high x-ray energies renders conventional phase-retrieval algorithms unsuitable for three-dimensional reconstruction. To address this problem, we utilize a phase-retrieval method with a Fourier constraint specifically tailored for undersampled diffraction data measured with coarse-pitched detector pixels that bin the underlying signal. With our approach, we show that it is possible to reconstruct three-dimensional strained crystallites from an undersampled Bragg diffraction data set subject to pixel-area integration without having to physically upsample the diffraction signal. Using simulations and experimental results, we demonstrate that explicit modeling of Fourier-space compression during phase retrieval provides a viable means by which to invert high-energy {BCDI} data, which is otherwise intractable.},

	title = {The application of dispersion relations (Hilbert transforms) to phase retrieval},
	abstract = {A method is given for the retrieval of phase from amplitude information using the Hilbert transform, without the need for evaluating Blaschke factors. The connection between causality and dispersion relations is well known (Toll 1956). Dispersion relations connect, for example, the real part of a function to an integral involving the imaginary part. Such relations occur in the form of the Kramers-Kronig relation in optics (Loudon 1973), in particle scattering (van Kampen 1953, Hilgevoord 1960, Roman 1965), in electron optics (Misell et al 1974), and in communication theory (Kuo and Freeny 1962). This integral relation may be defined by the Hilbert transform for a function y (t) : where P denotes the Cauchy principal value, It has been shown (Titchmarsh 1948) that equations (1) and (2) follow if the Fourier transform of y (t) vanishes for negative values of its argument, and y (t) is the limit as T +. t of an analytic function y ({\textasciitilde}) , where T = t + is, which is regular for s {\textgreater} 0. Equations (1) and (2) have been used to determine the phase \$(t) of y (t) when an estimate of Re [ y (t) ] (or Im [ y (t) ]) is available (Misell et a1 1974). In general only Iy(t)/ is measured experimentally, and it is of value to explore the direct determination of \$(t) from Iy(t)l (Page 1955, Toll 1956, Pefina 1971). The minimal phase \$(t) may be determined from the equation (see, for example, Pefina 1971). In general there are two sources of additional phase factors to \&t): (i) the product of Blaschke phase factors arising from the zeros of y ({\textasciitilde}) in the upper half-plane (s{\textgreater}O); (ii) an additive phase factor, linearly dependent on t (van Kampen 1953, Toll 1956), which reflects the fact that only Iy(t)l is known on the real axis. This second factor follows since Iy(t)l {IG}(t)l is indistinguishable from Iy(t)l, if G(T) is any bounded analytic function in the upper half-plane and {IG}(T)I = 1, almost 61 L65},

The mathematics of the problem provides unusual insights into the nature of electromagnetic fields. The theory is reviewed and illustrated. The basic issue of the phase retrieval problem, stated for a one-di-mensional field, is that although a unique Fourier transform relation exists between the field F(x) in the Fraunhofer plane and the field u(x') in the object plane, the infinite fold phase ambiguity which appears as the result of the possibilities of conjugating the zeros of F(z), z = x + jy implies that additional information or processing of the object wave must be available to obtain the phase. Among the possible solutions which are described are reference beam addition, apodization and the use of multiple intensity distributions, permitting the use of iterative computational procedures in some applications.

	abstract = {Phase retrieval ({PR}) is about reconstructing a signal from the magnitude of a number of its complex-valued linear measurements. Recent rapid progress has been made on the development of neural network ({NN}) based methods for {PR}. Most of these methods employ pre-trained {NNs} for modeling target signals, and they require collecting large-scale datasets with ground-truth signals for pre-training, which can be very challenging in many scenarios. There are a few unsupervised learning methods employing untrained {NN} priors for {PR} which avoid using external datasets; however, their performance is unsatisfactory compared to pre-trained-{NN}-based methods. This paper proposes an unsupervised learning method for {PR} which does not rely on pre-trained {NNs} while providing state-of-the-art performance. The proposed method trains a randomly-initialized generative {NN} for signal reconstruction directly on the magnitude measurements of a target signal, which approximates the minimum mean squared error estimator via dropout-based model averaging. Such a model-averaging-based approach provides a better internal prior for the target signal than existing untrained-{NN}-based methods. The experiments on image reconstruction demonstrate both the advantage of our method over existing unsupervised methods and its competitive performance to pre-trained-{NN}-based methods.},

	abstract = {Abstract: X-ray Bragg coherent diffraction imaging is a powerful technique for operando and in situ materials characterization and provides a unique means of quantifying the influence of one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) material defects on material response. However, obtaining full images from raw x-ray diffraction data is nontrivial and computationally intensive, precluding real-time experimental feedback. Here, we present a machine learning approach to identify the presence of crystalline line defects (edge and screw) in samples from the raw, 2D, coherent diffraction data without the need for image reconstruction through iterative phase retrieval. We compare different approaches to designing neural networks for this application and demonstrate the potential of automated {ML} ({autoML}) approaches. Impact statement: The need for automated processing of coherent diffraction data is strongly motivated by the advent of fourth-generation synchrotron x-ray sources, where coherent diffraction data will be generated at a tremendous rate and human interaction with data analysis, and especially iterative phase retrieval image reconstruction, will become untenable. Our approach provides a path to dealing with this necessary improvement in data processing efficiency. We expect that this work, which demonstrates the applicability of automated machine learning to x-ray analysis, will be of broad interest to scientists and users of synchrotron and {XFEL} facilities.

It is designed to be faithful to heterogeneities that potentially manifest as phase discontinuities in the coherently diffracted wave, such as lattice dislocations in an imperfect crystal. We retain fidelity to such small features in the reconstruction process through a Fourier transform -based resampling algorithm designed to largely avoid the point spread tendencies of commonly employed interpolation methods. The reconstruction model defined in this manner brings {BCDI} reconstruction into the scope of explicit optimization driven by automatic differentiation. With results from simulations and experimental diffraction data, we demonstrate significant improvement in the final image quality compared to conventional phase retrieval, enabled by explicitly coupling multiple {BCDI} datasets into the reconstruction loss function.},

This ability to cut solid matter on the nano-scale revolutionised sample preparation across the life, earth and materials sciences. Despite its widespread usage, detailed understanding of the {FIB}-induced structural damage, intrinsic to the technique, remains elusive. Here we examine the defects caused by {FIB} in initially pristine objects. Using Bragg Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging ({BCDI}), we are able to spatially-resolve the full lattice strain tensor in {FIB}-milled gold nano-crystals. We find that every use of {FIB} causes large lattice distortions. Even very low ion doses, typical of {FIB} imaging and previously thought negligible, have a dramatic effect. Our results are consistent with a damage microstructure dominated by vacancies, highlighting the importance of free-surfaces in determining which defects are retained. At larger ion fluences, used during {FIB}-milling, we observe an extended dislocation network that causes stresses far beyond the bulk tensile strength of gold. These observations provide new fundamental insight into the nature of the damage created and the defects that lead to a surprisingly inhomogeneous morphology.},

A single defect alone can yield strong and fine features that are observed in high-resolution diffraction experiments such as coherent X-ray diffraction. The case of face-centred cubic nanocrystals is studied numerically and the signatures of typical defects close to Bragg positions are identified. Crystals of a few tens of nanometres are modelled with realistic atomic potentials and 'relaxed' after introduction of well defined defects such as pure screw or edge dislocations, or Frank or prismatic loops. Diffraction patterns calculated in the kinematic approximation reveal various signatures of the defects depending on the Miller indices. They are strongly modified by the dissociation of the dislocations. Selection rules on the Miller indices are provided, to observe the maximum effect of given crystal defects in the initial and relaxed configurations. The effect of several physical and geometrical parameters such as stacking fault energy, crystal shape and defect position are discussed. The method is illustrated on a complex structure resulting from the simulated nanoindentation of a gold nanocrystal.},

	title = {On the Extendibility of X-ray Crystallography to Noncrystals},
	abstract = {This paper discusses the concept that crystallinity is not an essential requirement for applying the techniques of • X-ray crystal structure analysis. Assuming this to be true, the removal of crystallinity as a prerequisite for the techniques would allow the imaging of structures well beyond the present range of sizes accessible to X-ray crystallography. An example of an imageable structure could be a single small biological cell, containing perhaps 1013-1014 Da. The proposed concept differs from the usual diffraction method of studying noncrystalline structure, i.e. small-angle scattering, in carrying out the diffraction experiment and subsequent processing as if the structure being studied were in fact the asymmetric unit of a crystal: i.e.: orienting the structure in all directions in the X-ray beam needed to explore its Fourier transform (F transform), and phasing and inverting the transform to obtain• the electron-density image of the structure. The one actual difference from the crystal case is that the F transform is faint and also continuous, rather than displaying discrete intense Bragg spots. As a result, to get a readable pattern, the structure must be exposed to high levels of radiation. This last fact creates the principal limitation of the technique. With single air-dried biological cells at room temperature as diffracting specimens and soft X-rays in the wavelength range 18-32 A, patterns to date have not been observed beyond resolutions of 140-300 A before radiation damage has become evident. At this resolution, the technique nevertheless would lie on the same curve of resolution vs {\textasciitilde}specimen size as do the existing majot" imaging techniques of X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy and light microscopy, falling directly between the latter two. Thus, X-ray diffractive imaging is not destroyed by the withdrawal of crystallinity but instead is shifted to a new size range of stmc3ures, which have hitherto been somewhat inaccessible to imaging. A method for phasing the diffraction pattern, based on the ability to sample the pattern more finely than in the case of the crystalline specimen, is giving good results in preliminary testing.},

As it pervades a broad variety of applications, many researchers have striven to develop phase-retrieval algorithms. Classical approaches involve techniques as varied as generic gradient-descent routines or specialized spectral methods, to name a few. Yet, the phase-recovery problem remains a challenge to this day. Recently, however, advances in machine learning have revitalized the study of phase retrieval in two ways: significant theoretical advances have emerged from the analogy between phase retrieval and single-layer neural networks; practical breakthroughs have been obtained thanks to deep-learning regularization. In this tutorial, we review phase retrieval under a unifying framework that encompasses classical and machine-learning methods. We focus on three key elements: applications, overview of recent reconstruction algorithms, and the latest theoretical results.},

The ability to identify defects from the diffraction pattern alone would be a significant advantage when targeting specific defect types and accelerates experiment design and execution. Here, we exploit a computational tool based on a three-dimensional (3D) parametric atomistic model and a convolutional neural network to predict dislocations in a crystal from its 3D coherent diffraction pattern. Simulated diffraction patterns from several thousands of relaxed atomistic configurations of nanocrystals are used to train the neural network and to predict the presence or absence of dislocations as well as their type (screw or edge).

	abstract = {Ptychography has rapidly grown in the fields of X-ray and electron imaging for its unprecedented ability to achieve nano or atomic scale resolution while simultaneously retrieving chemical or magnetic information from a sample. A ptychographic reconstruction is achieved by means of solving a complex inverse problem that imposes constraints both on the acquisition and on the analysis of the data, which typically precludes real-time imaging due to computational cost involved in solving this inverse problem. In this work we propose {PtychoNN}, a novel approach to solve the ptychography reconstruction problem based on deep convolutional neural networks. We demonstrate how the proposed method can be used to predict real-space structure and phase at each scan point solely from the corresponding far-field diffraction data. The presented results demonstrate how {PtychoNN} can effectively be used on experimental data, being able to generate high quality reconstructions of a sample up to hundreds of times faster than state-of-the-art ptychography reconstruction solutions once trained. By surpassing the typical constraints of iterative model-based methods, we can significantly relax the data acquisition sampling conditions and produce equally satisfactory reconstructions. Besides drastically accelerating acquisition and analysis, this capability can enable new imaging scenarios that were not possible before, in cases of dose sensitive, dynamic and extremely voluminous samples.},

Its main advantage is that information about the three-dimensional structure of the object is already contained in a single image. This makes it useful for the reconstruction of fragile and non-reproducible particles without the need for tomographic measurements. However, currently there is no efficient numerical inversion algorithm available that is capable of determining the object's structure in real time. Neural networks, on the other hand, excel in image processing tasks suited for such purpose. Here we show how a physics-informed deep neural network can be used to reconstruct complete three-dimensional object models of uniform, convex particles on a voxel grid from single two-dimensional wide-angle scattering patterns. We demonstrate its universal reconstruction capabilities for silver nanoclusters, where the network uncovers novel geometric structures that reproduce the experimental scattering data with very high precision.},

Moreover, by making use of recent developments related to sampling in shift-invariant spaces by Gröchenig, Romero and Stöckler, we prove analogous uniqueness results for functions in shift-invariant spaces with Gaussian generator. Generalizations to nonuniform sampling are also presented. Finally, we compare our results to the situation where the considered signals are assumed to be real-valued.},

	abstract = {Phase retrieval, the problem of recovering lost phase information from measured intensity alone, is an inverse problem that is widely faced in various imaging modalities ranging from astronomy to nanoscale imaging. The current process of phase recovery is iterative in nature. As a result, the image formation is time consuming and computationally expensive, precluding real-time imaging. Here, we use 3D nanoscale X-ray imaging as a representative example to develop a deep learning model to address this phase retrieval problem. We introduce 3D-{CDI}-{NN}, a deep convolutional neural network and differential programing framework trained to predict 3D structure and strain, solely from input 3D X-ray coherent scattering data. Our networks are designed to be "physics-aware"in multiple aspects; in that the physics of the X-ray scattering process is explicitly enforced in the training of the network, and the training data are drawn from atomistic simulations that are representative of the physics of the material. We further refine the neural network prediction through a physics-based optimization procedure to enable maximum accuracy at lowest computational cost. 3D-{CDI}-{NN} can invert a 3D coherent diffraction pattern to real-space structure and strain hundreds of times faster than traditional iterative phase retrieval methods. Our integrated machine learning and differential programing solution to the phase retrieval problem is broadly applicable across inverse problems in other application areas.},

Presented here is a methodological framework for {IPAs} termed the half-cycle multigrid ({HMG}) for use in phase retrieval to alleviate the twin-image problem during the iterative process. {HMG} reconstructs the low-frequency phase first to reduce the impact of oscillation caused by phase retrieval in the higher-frequency region of Fourier space during the iteration. The higher-frequency Fourier magnitude is then added to the reconstruction stage by stage using the multigrid method. The unification of phase retrieval orientation in the low-frequency region lays the foundation for that in the whole Fourier space. The reconstruction results of simulated and experimental diffraction patterns demonstrate that {HMG} effectively reduces the probability of the twin-image problem occurring, enhances the accuracy of low-frequency information, and achieves credible and faithful reconstruction results from noisy diffraction patterns. The combination of {HMG} with the oversampling smoothness framework allows more reliable reconstruction results, proving that the {HMG} framework has good extensibility.

	abstract = {Coherent diffraction imaging ({CDI}) is high-resolution lensless microscopy that has been applied to image a wide range of specimens using synchrotron radiation, X-ray free-electron lasers, high harmonic generation, soft X-ray lasers and electrons. Despite recent rapid advances, it remains a challenge to reconstruct fine features in weakly scattering objects such as biological specimens from noisy data. Here an effective iterative algorithm, termed oversampling smoothness ({OSS}), for phase retrieval of noisy diffraction intensities is presented. {OSS} exploits the correlation information among the pixels or voxels in the region outside of a support in real space. By properly applying spatial frequency filters to the pixels or voxels outside the support at different stages of the iterative process (i.e. a smoothness constraint), {OSS} finds a balance between the hybrid input-output ({HIO}) and error reduction ({ER}) algorithms to search for a global minimum in solution space, while reducing the oscillations in the reconstruction. Both numerical simulations with Poisson noise and experimental data from a biological cell indicate that {OSS} consistently outperforms the {HIO}, {ER}-{HIO} and noise robust ({NR})-{HIO} algorithms at all noise levels in terms of accuracy and consistency of the reconstructions. It is expected that {OSS} will find application in the rapidly growing {CDI} field, as well as other disciplines where phase retrieval from noisy Fourier magnitudes is needed.

It has proven to be a powerful tool, but as with any rapidly developing field, the deluge of information can be overwhelming, confusing and sometimes misleading. This can make it easy to become lost in the same hype cycles that have historically ended in the periods of scarce funding and depleted expectations known as {AI} Winters. Furthermore, while the importance of innovative, high-risk research cannot be overstated, it is also imperative to understand the fundamental limits of available techniques, especially in young fields where the rules appear to be constantly rewritten and as the likelihood of application to high-stakes scenarios increases. In this perspective, we highlight the guiding principles of data-driven modeling, how these principles imbue models with almost magical predictive power, and how they also impose limitations on the scope of problems they can address. Particularly, understanding when not to use data-driven techniques, such as machine learning, is not something commonly explored, but is just as important as knowing how to apply the techniques properly. We hope that the discussion to follow provides researchers throughout the sciences with a better understanding of when said techniques are appropriate, the pitfalls to watch for, and most importantly, the confidence to leverage the power they can provide.},

It is well known that due to the loss of Fourier phase the problem in one-dimensional (1D) is ill-posed. Without further constraints, there is no unique solution to the problem. In contrast, uniqueness up to trivial ambiguities very often exists in higher dimensions, with mild constraints on the input. In this paper, we focus on the 2D phase retrieval problem and provide insight into this uniqueness property by exploring the connection between the 2D and 1D formulations. In particular, we show that 2D phase retrieval can be cast as a 1D problem with additional constraints, which limit the solution space. We then prove that only one additional constraint is sufficient to reduce the many feasible solutions in the 1D setting to a unique solution for almost all signals. These results allow to obtain an analytical approach (with combinatorial complexity) to solve the 2D phase retrieval problem when it is unique.},

Phase retrieval algorithms are based on the fast Fourier transform ({FFT}). We demonstrate how to calculate the displacement field inside a nanocrystal from its reconstructed phase depending on the mathematical convention used for the {FFT}. We use numerical simulations to quantify the influence of experimentally unavoidable detector deficiencies such as blind areas or limited dynamic range as well as post-processing filtering on the reconstruction. We also propose a criterion for the isosurface determination of the object, based on the histogram of the reconstructed modulus. Finally, we study the capability of the phasing algorithm to quantitatively retrieve the surface strain (i.e., the strain of the surface voxels). This work emphasizes many aspects that have been neglected so far in {BCDI}, which need to be understood for a quantitative analysis of displacement and strain based on this technique.

	abstract = {Reconstruction of a stable and reliable solution from noisy and incomplete Fourier intensity data is a challenging problem for iterative phase retrieval algorithms. The typical methodology employed in the coherent X-ray imaging ({CXI}) literature involves thousands of iterations of well-known phase retrieval algorithms, e.g., hybrid input-output ({HIO}) or relaxed averaged alternating reflections ({RAAR}), that are concluded with a smaller number of error reduction ({ER}) iterations. Since the single run of this methodology may not provide a reliable solution, hundreds of trial solutions are first obtained by initializing the phase retrieval algorithm with independent random guesses. The resulting trial solutions are then averaged with appropriate phase adjustment, and resolution of the averaged reconstruction is assessed by plotting the phase retrieval transfer function ({PRTF}). In this work, we examine this commonly used {RAAR}-{ER} methodology from the perspective of the complexity parameter introduced by us in recent years. It is observed that the single run of the {RAAR}-{ER} algorithm provides a solution with undesirable grainy artifacts that persist to some extent even after averaging the multiple trial solutions. The grainy features are spurious in the sense that they are smaller in size compared to the resolution predicted by the {PRTF} curve. This inconsistency can be addressed by a novel methodology that we refer to as complexity-guided {RAAR} ({CG}-{RAAR}). The methodology is demonstrated with simulations and experimental data sets from the {CXIDB} database. In addition to providing consistent solution, {CG}-{RAAR} is also observed to require reduced number of independent trials for averaging.},

In this article, the challenges posed by noise and masks are tackled by introducing a neural network pipeline that aims to restore diffraction intensities. For training and testing of the model, a data set of diffraction patterns was simulated from 10 900 different proteins with molecular weights within the range of 10-100 {kDa} and collected at a photon energy of 8 {keV}. The method is compared with a simple low-pass filtering algorithm based on autocorrelation constraints. The results show an improvement in the mean-squared error of roughly two orders of magnitude in the presence of masks compared with the noisy data. The algorithm was also tested at increasing mask width, leading to the conclusion that demasking can achieve good results when the mask is smaller than half of the central speckle of the pattern. The results highlight the competitiveness of this model for data processing and the feasibility of restoring diffraction intensities from unknown structures in real time using deep learning methods. Finally, an example is shown of this preprocessing making orientation recovery more reliable, especially for data sets containing very few patterns, using the expansion-maximization-compression algorithm.},

	abstract = {Optical coherence tomography angiography ({OCTA}) requires high transverse sampling density for visualizing retinal and choroidal capillaries. Low transverse sampling causes digital resolution degradation, such as the angiograms in wide-field {OCTA}. In this paper, we propose to address this problem using deep learning. We conducted extensive experiments on converting the centrally cropped 3 × 3 mm 2 field of view ({FOV}) of the 8 × 8 mm 2 foveal {OCTA} images (a sampling density of 22.9 µ m) to the native 3 × 3 mm 2 en face {OCTA} images (a sampling density of 12.2 µ m). We employed a cycle-consistent adversarial network architecture in this conversion. The quantitative analysis using the perceptual similarity measures shows the generated {OCTA} images are closer to the native 3 × 3 mm 2 scans. Besides, the results show the proposed method could also enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. We further applied our method to enhance diseased cases and calculate vascular biomarkers, which demonstrates its generalization performance and clinical perspective.},

In 1999, a novel form of microscopy, i.e., coherent diffraction imaging (also termed coherent diffraction microscopy or lensless imaging), was developed and transformed our conventional view of microscopy, in which the diffraction pattern of a noncrystalline specimen or a nanocrystal was first measured and then directly phased to obtain a high-resolution image. The well-known phase problem was solved by combining the oversampling method with iterative algorithms. In this paper, we will briefly discuss the principle of coherent diffraction imaging, present various implementation schemes of this imaging modality, and illustrate its broad applications in materials science, nanoscience, and biology. As coherent X-ray sources such as high harmonic generation and X-ray free-electron lasers are presently under rapid development worldwide, coherent diffraction imaging can potentially be applied to perform high-resolution imaging of materials/nanoscience and biological specimens at the femtosecond time scale. © 2006 {IEEE}.},

	abstract = {This paper shows how information theory can both drive the digital image inpainting process and the optical illusion due to the blind spot. The defended position is that the missing information is padded by the "most probable information around" via a simple filling-in scheme. Thus the proposed algorithm aims to keep the entropy constant. It cares not to create too much novelty as well as not to destroy too much information. For this, the image is broken down into regular squares in order to build a dictionary of unique words and to estimate the entropy. Then the occluded region is completed, word by word and layer by layer, by picking the element which respects the existing image, which minimizes the entropy deviation if there are several candidates, and which limits its potential increase in the case where no compatible word exists and where a new one must be introduced.},

	abstract = {The routine atomic resolution structure determination of single particles is expected to have profound implications for probing structure-function relationships in systems ranging from energy-storage materials to biological molecules. Extremely bright ultrashort-pulse X-ray sources - X-ray free-electron lasers ({XFELs}) - provide X-rays that can be used to probe ensembles of nearly identical nanoscale particles. When combined with coherent diffractive imaging, these objects can be imaged; however, as the resolution of the images approaches the atomic scale, the measured data are increasingly difficult to obtain and, during an X-ray pulse, the number of photons incident on the 2D detector is much smaller than the number of pixels. This latter concern, the signal 'sparsity', materially impedes the application of the method. An experimental analog using a conventional X-ray source is demonstrated and yields signal levels comparable with those expected from single biomolecules illuminated by focused {XFEL} pulses. The analog experiment provides an invaluable cross check on the fidelity of the reconstructed data that is not available during {XFEL} experiments. Using these experimental data, it is established that a sparsity of order 1.3 × 10 -3 photons per pixel per frame can be overcome, lending vital insight to the solution of the atomic resolution {XFEL} single-particle imaging problem by experimentally demonstrating 3D coherent diffractive imaging from photon-sparse random projections.},

	abstract = {Diffraction imaging problem, i.e. recovery of a high-resolution or high-quality image from the intensity diffraction pattern, arises in many science and engineering fields. Recent efforts to solve this problem are exploiting sparse representation techniques. However, existing sparse representation models cannot explore inherent priors of the images to be reconstructed sufficiently. Imaging algorithms employed such traditional sparse representation models often suffer from low-quality reconstructions in the case of the noise or low-resolution observation. To address this issue, we propose a deep prior-based sparse representation ({DPSR}) regularization model that can impose the sparsity and the deep prior on the unknown image. The {DPSR} model is a plug-and-play model, namely that one can plug any effective deep denoiser into this model. We apply this model to coded diffraction imaging. To perform high-resolution imaging, a sub-pixel resolution coded diffraction pattern observation model is proposed. Based on this observation model, a diffraction imaging optimization problem is formulated. The formulated optimization problem is tackled by using the alternating optimization strategy and the epigraph concept. Compared to the benchmark diffraction imaging algorithms, the proposed algorithm has a notable peak signal-to-noise ratio ({PSNR}) gain of about 2 {dB}. Meanwhile, the proposed algorithm can perform high-resolution diffraction imaging with the pixel super-resolution factor of 4 under the single observation case. A demo code of the proposed algorithm is available at https://github.com/shibaoshun/{DPSR}.},

Investigating the response of a skyrmion to an applied external field in real space is effective for understanding its characteristics. Such observations require a real-space imaging technique with high temporal and spatial resolution. Coherent X-ray diffraction imaging is a powerful technique for observing magnetic skyrmions that takes advantage of a short X-ray pulse and short wavelength. However, the magnetic scattering intensity from isolated magnetic skyrmions is weaker than that of the magnetic skyrmion lattice and thus is susceptible to noise. In this study, we propose a sparse phase retrieval algorithm ({SpPRA}), which involves an iterative Fourier transform and sparse modeling, and we demonstrated that it can retrieve the phase from diffraction data including noise and missing information. Considering the sparseness of the magnetic distribution as regularization enables preventing overfitting the noise and predicting the diffraction data of the missing region.},

	abstract = {Coherent X-ray photons with energies higher than 50 {keV} offer new possibilities for imaging nanoscale lattice distortions in bulk crystalline materials using Bragg peak phase retrieval methods. However, the compression of reciprocal space at high energies typically results in poorly resolved fringes on an area detector, rendering the diffraction data unsuitable for the three-dimensional reconstruction of compact crystals. To address this problem, we propose a method by which to recover fine fringe detail in the scattered intensity. This recovery is achieved in two steps: multiple undersampled measurements are made by in-plane sub-pixel motion of the area detector, then this data set is passed to a sparsity-based numerical solver that recovers fringe detail suitable for standard Bragg coherent diffraction imaging ({BCDI}) reconstruction methods of compact single crystals. The key insight of this paper is that sparsity in a {BCDI} data set can be enforced by recognising that the signal in the detector, though poorly resolved, is band-limited. This requires fewer in-plane detector translations for complete signal recovery, while adhering to information theory limits. We use simulated {BCDI} data sets to demonstrate the approach, outline our sparse recovery strategy, and comment on future opportunities.},

Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and {DIC}) we won the {ISBI} cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin.

However, the reasons for these differences, and their effects on the underlying loss landscape, are not well understood. In this paper, we explore the structure of neural loss functions, and the effect of loss landscapes on generalization, using a range of visualization methods. First, we introduce a simple "filter normalization" method that helps us visualize loss function curvature and make meaningful side-by-side comparisons between loss functions. Then, using a variety of visualizations, we explore how network architecture affects the loss landscape, and how training parameters affect the shape of minimizers.},

However, for images on photographic material, images can have defects at the point of captured, become damaged, or degrade over time.

The advent of the digital age has seen the rapid shift image storage technologies, from hard-copies to digitalised units in a less burdensome manner with the application of digital tools. This paper presents a comprehensive review of image inpainting methods over the past decade and the commonly used performance metrics and datasets. To increase the clarity of our review, we use a hierarchical representation for the past state-of-the-art traditional methods and the present state-of-the-art deep learning methods. For traditional methods, we divide the techniques into five sub-categories, i.e. Exemplar-based texture synthesis, Exemplar-based structure synthesis, Diffusion-based methods, Sparse representation methods and Hybrid methods. Then we review the deep learning methods, i.e. Convolutional Neural Networks and Generative Adversarial Networks. We detail the strengths and weaknesses of each to provide new insights in the field.

Their effects range from increased chemical reactivity to enhanced mechanical properties. Dislocations have been widely studied using traditional techniques such as X-ray diffraction and optical imaging. Recent advances have enabled atomic force microscopy to study single dislocations in two dimensions, while transmission electron microscopy ({TEM}) can now visualize strain fields in three dimensions with near-atomic resolution. However, these techniques cannot offer three-dimensional imaging of the formation or movement of dislocations during dynamic processes. Here, we describe how Bragg coherent diffraction imaging ({BCDI}; refs,) can be used to visualize in three dimensions, the entire network of dislocations present within an individual calcite crystal during repeated growth and dissolution cycles. These investigations demonstrate the potential of {BCDI} for studying the mechanisms underlying the response of crystalline materials to external stimuli.},

abstract = {Summary The microscopic image is important data for recording the microstructure information of materials. Researchers usually use image-processing algorithms to extract material features from that and then characterise the material microstructure. However, the microscopic images obtained by a microscope often have random damaged regions, which will cause the loss of information and thus inevitably influence the accuracy of microstructural characterisation, even lead to a wrong result. To handle this problem, we provide a deep learning-based fully automatic method for detecting and inpainting damaged regions in material microscopic images, which can automatically inpaint damaged regions with different positions and shapes, as well as we also use a data augmentation method to improve the performance of inpainting model. We evaluate our method on Al–La alloy microscopic images, which indicates that our method can achieve promising performance on inpainted and material microstructure characterisation results compared to other image inpainting software for both accuracy and time consumption. Lay Description A basic goal of materials data analysis is to extract useful information from materials datasets that can in turn be used to establish connections along the composition–processing–structure–properties chain. The microscopic images obtained by a microscope is the key carrier of material microstructural information. Researchers usually use image analysis algorithms to extract regions of interest or useful features from microscopic images, aiming to analyse material microstructure, organ tissues or device quality etc. Therefore, the integrity and clarity of the microscopic image are the most important attributes for image feature extraction. Scientists and engineers have been trying to develop various technologies to obtain perfect microscopic images. However, in practice, some extrinsic defects are often introduced during the preparation and/or shooting processes, and the elimination of these defects often requires mass efforts and cost, or even is impossible at present. Take the microstructure image of metallic material for example, samples prepared to microstructure characterisation often need to go through several steps such as cutting, grinding with sandpaper, polishing, etching, and cleaning. During the grinding and polishing process, defects such as scratches could be introduced. During the etching and cleaning process, some defects such as rust caused by substandard etching, stains etc. may arise and be persisted. These defects can be treated as damaged regions with nonfixed positions, different sizes, and random shapes, resulting in the loss of information, which seriously affects subsequent visual observation and microstructural feature extraction. To handle this problem, we provide a deep learning-based fully automatic method for detecting and inpainting damaged regions in material microscopic images, which can automatically inpaint damaged regions with different positions and shapes, as well as we also use a data augmentation method to improve the performance of inpainting model. We evaluate our method on Al–La alloy microscopic images, which indicates that our method can achieve promising performance on inpainted and material microstructure characterisation results compared to other image inpainting software for both accuracy and time consumption.},

The uncertainty of the object support can lead to over-fitting and prevents an unambiguous metric evaluation of solutions. We propose to use a ‘free’ log-likelihood indicator, where a small percentage of points are masked from the reconstruction algorithms, as an unbiased metric to evaluate the validity of computed solutions, independent of the sample studied. We also show how a set of solutions can be analysed through an eigen-decomposition to yield a better estimate of the real object. Example analysis on experimental data is presented both for a test pattern dataset, and the diffraction pattern from a live cyanobacteria cell. The method allows the validation of reconstructions on a wide range of materials (hard condensed or biological), and should be particularly relevant for 4th generation synchrotrons and X-ray free electron lasers, where large, high-throughput datasets require a method for unsupervised data evaluation.},

   abstract = {Phase transitions in reactive environments are crucially important in energy and information storage, catalysis and sensors. Nanostructuring active particles can yield faster charging/ discharging kinetics, increased lifespan and record catalytic activities. However, establishing the causal link between structure and function is challenging for nanoparticles, as ensemble measurements convolve intrinsic single-particle properties with sample diversity. Here we study the hydriding phase transformation in individual palladium nanocubes in situ using coherent X-ray diffractive imaging. The phase transformation dynamics, which involve the nucleation and propagation of a hydrogen-rich region, are dependent on absolute time (aging) and involve intermittent dynamics (avalanching). A hydrogen-rich surface layer dominates the crystal strain in the hydrogen-poor phase, while strain inversion occurs at the cube corners in the hydrogen-rich phase. A three-dimensional phase-field model is used to interpret the experimental results. Our experimental and theoretical approach provides a general framework for designing and optimizing phase transformations for single nanocrys-tals in reactive environments.},

Although overall shape or size changes of nanocatalysts have been observed as a result of catalytic processes, structural changes at low-coordination sites such as edges, remain poorly understood. Here, we report high-lattice distortion at edges of Pt nanocrystals during heterogeneous catalytic methane oxidation based on in situ 3D Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging. We directly observe contraction at edges owing to adsorption of oxygen. This strain increases during methane oxidation and it returns to the original state after completing the reaction process. The results are in good agreement with finite element models that incorporate forces, as determined by reactive molecular dynamics simulations. Reaction mechanisms obtained from in situ strain imaging thus provide important insights for improving catalysts and designing future nanostructured catalytic materials.},

@article{Abuin2019,
   abstract = {Using coherent X-ray diffraction imaging (CXDI) as an in situ tool, we determined the shape and strain state of a platinum nanoparticle with ≈160 nm diameter supported by a strontium titanate substrate. The experiment was performed at a temperature of 400 K under continuous gas flow conditions of pure Ar and Ar/CO mixtures. The nanoparticle was preselected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and postanalyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). We obtain a very good agreement between the overall nanoparticle size, shape, and defect structure as determined by CXDI and AFM. In addition, we compare the strain state in the nanoparticle near surface region and its bulk: For pure Ar flow, we find a slight compressive strain in the nanoparticle bulk compared to an expansion in the near surface region. We ascribe the latter to the presence of high index vicinal surfaces. Our analysis suggests that under mixed Ar/CO flow at 400 K reshaping of the nanoparticle occurred. New high index facets developed, leading to a stronger lattice expansion, also propagating into the nanoparticle bulk. Our high-resolution experiments pave the way for future CXDI experiments under operando catalytic reaction conditions. Oxide-supported nanoparticles (NPs) play an eminent role as heterogeneous catalysts in exhaust gas cleaning, energy conversion, and storage. 1 A detailed understanding of catalytic reactions is mandatory for the future development of heterogeneous catalysts with higher activity, selectivity, and improved lifetime. It requires an in-depth structural characterization of heterogeneous catalysts, representing a material with a rather complex morphology, as they are composed of oxide-supported metal nanoparticles. The metal nanoparticle shape is directly related to the catalytic behavior since it defines the possible adsorption sites, characterized by different local geometry, and therefore the absorption energy. 2−8 Another important quantity is the nanoparticle's internal strain field, since it alters the adsorption probability and, thus, the activity and selectivity of the adsorption sites. 9−14 Because only a fraction of strained surface atoms can alter the catalytic activity, the atomic site-specific strain determination plays an important role. 15 Conventional studies provide an averaged information over NP ensembles characterized by an intrinsic size, shape, strain, and orientational distribution resulting from the synthesis process, which makes the interpretation of the results often challenging. Heterogeneous catalytic reactions often imply atmospheric pressures and elevated temperatures, representing an additional obstacle for atomic scale characterization. 16 One},

   abstract = {Nanostructures with specific crystallographic planes display distinctive physico-chemical properties because of their unique atomic arrangements, resulting in widespread applications in catalysis, energy conversion or sensing. Understanding strain dynamics and their relationship with crystallographic facets have been largely unexplored. Here, we reveal in situ, in three-dimensions and at the nanoscale, the volume, surface and interface strain evolution of single supported platinum nanocrystals during reaction using coherent x-ray diffractive imaging. Interestingly, identical \{hkl\} facets show equivalent catalytic response during non-stoichiometric cycles. Periodic strain variations are rationalised in terms of O 2 adsorption or desorption during O 2 exposure or CO oxidation under reducing conditions, respectively. During stoichiometric CO oxidation, the strain evolution is, however, no longer facet dependent. Large strain variations are observed in localised areas, in particular in the vicinity of the substrate/particle interface, suggesting a significant influence of the substrate on the reactivity. These findings will improve the understanding of dynamic properties in catalysis and related fields.},

These functions estimate only some similarity degree between a reference image and its distorted copy. It is proved experimentally that the {SSIM} index does not always correctly determine similarity of images of the same scene. The Pearson linear correlation is a better tool for similarity analysis and it is faster to calculate. It is experimentally demonstrated that the Pearson correlation better than the {SSIM} index coincides with the subjective {MOS} image estimates. It is shown that the Pearson correlation coefficient is non-linearly related to the Euclid metric, but no any linear transformation of the coefficient can be a metric function.

A better understanding of the mechanisms which generate {EZs} would help with understanding the possible importance of {EZs} in biology and in engineering applications such as filtration and microfluidics. Here we review the experimental evidence for {EZ} phenomena in water and the major theories that have been proposed. We review experimental results from birefringence, neutron radiography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and other studies. Pollack theorizes that water in the {EZ} exists has a different structure than bulk water, and that this accounts for the {EZ}. We present several alternative explanations for {EZs} and argue that Schurr’s theory based on diffusiophoresis presents a compelling alternative explanation for the core {EZ} phenomenon. Among other things, Schurr’s theory makes predictions about the growth of the {EZ} with time which have been confirmed by Florea et al. and others. We also touch on several possible confounding factors that make experimentation on {EZs} difficult, such as charged surface groups, dissolved solutes, and adsorbed nanobubbles.},

	abstract = {The properties of water molecules located close to an interface deviate significantly from those observed in the homogeneous bulk liquid. The length scale over which this structural perturbation persists (the so-called interfacial depth) is the object of extensive investigations. The situation is particularly complicated in the presence of surface charges that can induce long-range orientational ordering of water molecules, which in turn dictate diverse processes, such as mineral dissolution, heterogeneous catalysis, and membrane chemistry. To characterize the fundamental properties of interfacial water, we performed molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations on alkali chloride solutions in the presence of two types of idealized charged surfaces: one with the charge density localized at discrete sites and the other with a homogeneously distributed charge density. We find that, in addition to a diffuse region where water orientation shows no layering, the interface region consists of a "compact layer" of solvent next to the surface that is not described in classical electric double layer theories. The depth of the diffuse solvent layer is sensitive to the type of charge distributions on the surface and the ionic strength. Simulations of the aqueous interface of a realistic model of negatively charged amorphous silica show that the water orientation and the distribution of ions strongly depend on the identity of the cations (Na+ vs Cs+) and are not well represented by a simplistic homogeneous charge distribution model. While the compact layer shows different solvent net orientation and depth for Na+ vs Cs+, the depth (∼1 nm) of the diffuse layer of oriented waters is independent of the identity of the cation screening the charge. The details of interfacial water orientation revealed here go beyond the traditionally used double and triple layer models and provide a microscopic picture of the aqueous/mineral interface that complements recent surface specific experimental studies. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

However, the periodic solar radiation somehow limits the widespread use of solar energy. Analogous to solar irradiation, water can also be found on Earth as a natural resource. Wherein, the presence of water is less restricted by the environmental conditions since it could exist in diverse forms. Therefore, harvesting green energy from water is a promising alternative to traditional energy conversion technologies. In this review, we have summarized the recent progress of water-induced electricity generation based on 2D materials. Starting with descriptions of the mechanisms proposed so far, four categories of water-induced electricity are discussed, which are across the droplet, flow, evaporation, and moisture. This review concludes with a perspective on current challenges and future directions for electricity generation from water. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 {BLEU} on the {WMT} 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 {BLEU}. On the {WMT} 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art {BLEU} score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight {GPUs}, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

Imaging the dynamics of domains and domain walls at ultrafast timescales can provide fundamental clues to features that impact electrical transport in electronic devices.

While the Fourier imaging model involves complex-valued quantities, most existing deep learning based methods solve the {PR} problem with real-valued based models, where the connection between amplitude and phase is ignored. To this end, we involve complex numbers operation in the neural network to preserve the amplitude and phase connection. Therefore, we employ the complex-valued neural network for solving the {PR} problem and evaluate it on Bragg coherent diffraction data streams collected from an epitaxial La2-{xSrxCuO}4 ({LSCO}) thin film using an X-ray Free Electron Laser ({XFEL}). Our proposed complex-valued neural network based approach outperforms the traditional real-valued neural network methods in both supervised and unsupervised learning manner.

This problem entails recovering a K-sparse signal of length N from its Fourier magnitude or, equivalently, from its periodic auto-correlation. Specifically, this work focuses on the fundamental question of uniqueness: what is the maximal sparsity level K/N that allows unique mapping between a signal and its Fourier magnitude, up to intrinsic symmetries. We design a systemic computational technique to affirm uniqueness for any specific pair (K,N), and establish the following conjecture: the Fourier magnitude determines a generic signal uniquely, up to intrinsic symmetries, as long as K{\textless}=N/2. Based on group-theoretic considerations and an additional computational technique, we formulate a second conjecture: if K{\textless}N/2, then for any signal the set of solutions to the crystallographic phase retrieval problem has measure zero in the set of all signals with a given Fourier magnitude. Together, these conjectures constitute the first attempt to establish a mathematical theory for the crystallographic phase retrieval problem.},

We present a method to heal X-ray scattering images, filling gaps in the data and removing defects in a physically meaningful manner. Unlike generic inpainting methods, this method is closely tuned to the expected structure of reciprocal-space data. In particular, we exploit statistical tests and symmetry analysis to identify the structure of an image; we then copy, average and interpolate measured data into gaps in a way that respects the identified structure and symmetry. Importantly, the underlying analysis methods provide useful characterization of structures present in the image, including the identification of diffuse versus sharp features, anisotropy and symmetry. The presented method leverages known characteristics of reciprocal space, enabling physically reasonable reconstruction even with large image gaps. The method will correspondingly fail for images that violate these underlying assumptions. The method assumes point symmetry and is thus applicable to small-angle X-ray scattering ({SAXS}) data, but only to a subset of wide-angle data. Our method succeeds in filling gaps and healing defects in experimental images, including extending data beyond the original detector borders.},

	abstract = {The density-matrix renormalization group ({DMRG}) is a numerical algorithm for the efficient trun-cation of the Hilbert space of low-dimensional strongly correlated quantum systems based on a rather general decimation prescription. This algorithm has achieved unprecedented precision in the description of one-dimensional quantum systems. It has therefore quickly acquired the status of method of choice for numerical studies of one-dimensional quantum systems. Its applications to the calculation of static, dynamic and thermodynamic quantities in such systems are reviewed. The potential of {DMRG} applications in the fields of two-dimensional quantum systems, quantum chemistry, three-dimensional small grains, nuclear physics, equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical physics, and time-dependent phenomena is discussed. This review also considers the theoretical foundations of the method, examining its relationship to matrix-product states and the quantum information content of the density matrices generated by {DMRG}.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks currently demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in several domains. At the same time, models of this class are very demanding in terms of computational resources. In particular, a large amount of memory is required by commonly used fully-connected layers, making it hard to use the models on low-end devices and stopping the further increase of the model size. In this paper we convert the dense weight matrices of the fully-connected layers to the Tensor Train format such that the number of parameters is reduced by a huge factor and at the same time the expressive power of the layer is preserved. In particular, for the Very Deep {VGG} networks we report the compression factor of the dense weight matrix of a fully-connected layer up to 200000 times leading to the compression factor of the whole network up to 7 times.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The physical properties of a quantum many-body system can, in principle, be determined by diagonalizing the respective Hamiltonian, but the dimensions of its matrix representation scale exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom. Hence, only small systems that are described through simple models can be tackled via exact diagonalization. To overcome this limitation, numerical methods based on the renormalization group paradigm that restrict the quantum many-body problem to a manageable subspace of the exponentially large full Hilbert space have been put forth. A striking example is the density-matrix renormalization group ({DMRG}), which has become the reference numerical method to obtain the low-energy properties of one-dimensional quantum systems with short-range interactions. Here, we provide a pedagogical introduction to {DMRG}, presenting both its original formulation and its modern tensor-network-based version. This colloquium sets itself apart from previous contributions in two ways. First, didactic code implementations are provided to bridge the gap between conceptual and practical understanding. Second, a concise and self-contained introduction to the tensor-network methods employed in the modern version of {DMRG} is given, thus allowing the reader to effortlessly cross the deep chasm between the two formulations of {DMRG} without having to explore the broad literature on tensor networks. We expect this pedagogical review to find wide readership among students and researchers who are taking their first steps in numerical simulations via {DMRG}.

Our method deviates from the standard recursive {SVD}-based procedure for constructing a tensor train. Instead, we formulate and solve a sequence of small linear systems for the individual tensor train cores. This approach can avoid the curse of dimensionality that threatens both the algorithmic and sample complexities of the recovery problem. Specifically, for Markov models under natural conditions, we prove that the tensor cores can be recovered with a sample complexity that scales logarithmically in the dimensionality. Finally, we illustrate the performance of the method with several numerical experiments.},

	abstract = {The optimization of the power consumption of antenna networks is a problem with a potential impact in the field of telecommunications. In this work, we investigate the application of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm ({QAOA}) and the quantum adiabatic algorithm ({QAA}), to the solution of a prototypical model in this field. We use statevector emulation in a high-performance computing environment to compare the performance of these two algorithms in terms of solution quality, using selected evaluation metrics. We estimate the circuit depth scaling with the problem size while maintaining a certain level of solution quality, and we extend our analysis up to 31 qubits, which is rarely addressed in the literature. Our calculations show that as the problem size increases, the probability of measuring the exact solution decreases exponentially for both algorithms. This issue is particularly severe when we include constraints in the problem, resulting in full connectivity between the sites. Nonetheless, we observe that the cumulative probability of measuring solutions close to the optimal one remains high also for the largest instances considered in this work. Our findings keep the way open to the application of these algorithms, or variants thereof, to generate suboptimal solutions at scales relevant to industrial use-cases.},

Today, science is a privileged profession, one with a (tacit) management mandate for systematic knowledge acquisition. Within this framework, science acts with responsibility. This chapter reflects the responsibility of science in the German context. After Wold War 2, the extraordinary responsibility of scientists, which C.F. von Weizsäcker emphasized, referred to a specific phase in the institutional development of science, termed scientism (“science justifies society,” science as religion), and corresponded to an elite responsibility. Today, one responsibility of science as a profession is to safeguard and develop scientific standards. This also concerns, on the one hand, the self-organization and control of science as a profession and, on the other hand, the communication of science to society. As a professional scientist, one has two responsibilities, the commitments to good science (professional ethics plus co-responsibility for the development of science as a profession) and civic responsibility. Due to their special knowledge, the civic responsibility of the scientist differs from that of other professionals. This chapter introduces science as a profession and presents an integrative notion of responsibility, also shedding light on the social responsibility of science.},

We propose Patch Gradient Descent ({PatchGD}), an effective learning strategy that allows to train the existing {CNN} architectures on large-scale images in an end-to-end manner. {PatchGD} is based on the hypothesis that instead of performing gradient-based updates on an entire image at once, it should be possible to achieve a good solution by performing model updates on only small parts of the image at a time, ensuring that the majority of it is covered over the course of iterations. {PatchGD} thus extensively enjoys better memory and compute efficiency when training models on large scale images. {PatchGD} is thoroughly evaluated on two datasets - {PANDA} and {UltraMNIST} with {ResNet}50 and {MobileNetV}2 models under different memory constraints. Our evaluation clearly shows that {PatchGD} is much more stable and efficient than the standard gradient-descent method in handling large images, and especially when the compute memory is limited.},

	doi = {10.1109/TPAMI.2020.3019563},
	abstract = {Due to memory constraints on current hardware, most convolution neural networks ({CNN}) are trained on sub-megapixel images. For example, most popular datasets in computer vision contain images much less than a megapixel in size (0.09MP for {ImageNet} and 0.001MP for {CIFAR}-10). In some domains such as medical imaging, multi-megapixel images are needed to identify the presence of disease accurately. We propose a novel method to directly train convolutional neural networks using any input image size end-to-end. This method exploits the locality of most operations in modern convolutional neural networks by performing the forward and backward pass on smaller tiles of the image. In this work, we show a proof of concept using images of up to 66-megapixels (8192×8192), saving approximately 50GB of memory per image. Using two public challenge datasets, we demonstrate that {CNNs} can learn to extract relevant information from these large images and benefit from increasing resolution. We improved the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve from 0.580 (4MP) to 0.706 (66MP) for metastasis detection in breast cancer ({CAMELYON}17). We also obtained a Spearman correlation metric approaching state-of-the-art performance on the {TUPAC}16 dataset, from 0.485 (1MP) to 0.570 (16MP).
