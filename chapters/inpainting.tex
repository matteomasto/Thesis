\chapter{Inpainting}\label{chp:inpainting}

In this chapter the "gap problem" in the BCDI field is introduced as well as the state of the art measures that are taken to tackle it. It follows then a presentation of the various approaches that have been investigated using Deep Learning (DL) to conclude with the optimal one that is also discussed in the scientific paper named \textit{"Patching-based deep learning model for the Inpainting of Bragg Cohrent Diffraction patterns affected by detectors' gaps"} (\url{https://doi.org/10.1107/S1600576724004163})
