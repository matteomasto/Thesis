In this Chapter the specific case of BCDI in presence of highly strained particle or large phase ranges will be introduced. 
In first place, some qualitative considerations will be made starting from Eq. \ref{eq:strain_fin3}, Eq.\ref{eq:strain_fin4} and 
Eq.\ref{eq:fourie_relation} regarding the effect of displacement fields on the resulting diffraction pattern. 

Secondly, the effect of Poisson noise in combination with strain will be discussed as well. 
Lastly, we will try to evaluate the complexity of the Phase Retrieval with the amount of strain inside the particle.
